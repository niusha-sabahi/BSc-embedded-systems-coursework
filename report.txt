# INS: Instructions

Menu

The game loads onto the menu where the first option "1: Play practice mode." is displayed,
you can press the up and down buttons to view these different menu options in the order below:

*"1: Play practice mode."
*"2: Play story mode."
*"3: Change sequence length (N)."
*"4: Change no. of keys (M)."
*"5: Change time limit (T)."

You can select a menu option by pressing the select button once that menu option has stopped scrolling.

1: Play practice mode

The practice mode is set to N=4, M=2, D=1.00 second and T=5.00 second at the start (N, M and T can be changed in menu).
Before playing the game, make sure to load up the serial monitor, this allows you to see the whole sequence per stage(s) 
in both practice and story mode so that you can test the game when the input is correct. 

Each new stage is indicated by "--New pattern--" and each key is printed in order on a new line. When playing practice mode, 
a single stage is displayed (each key is displayed individually in order), and then the timer starts for the first key.

The timer updates every 0.1 seconds and the game will be over if no key is entered before it runs out, however, if any key is
entered before it runs out, the timer resets and you have to enter the next key. This continues for all keys in the sequence.

If the sequence entered is correct, at the end the backlight flashes green and we return to menu, but if any of the keys were 
entered wrong, the game over message is displayed and we return to menu.

2: Play story mode

The story mode plays stages of increasing difficulty until the player enters a wrong sequence when the game over display is shown 
and they return to the menu. This means stages above 4 have N>10.

The first stage is set to N=4, M=2, D=3 seconds, T=5.00 seconds. Every successive stage becomes harder with some of these changing 
(they all change at least once by the 3rd stage). N and M increase and D and T decrease.

3: Change sequence length (N)

This menu option allows you to change N for the practice mode in the range 4-10.
Use up and down to increase/ decrease the number and press select when done.

4: Change no. of keys (M)

This menu option allows you to change M for the practice mode where:

*M=2 only uses the left and right keys.
*M=3 uses left, right and up.
*M=4 uses left, right, up and down.

Use up and down to increase/ decrease the number and press select when done.

5: Change time limit (T)

This menu option allows you to change the timer limit for practice mode,
it ranges from 1.50-5.00 seconds.

Use up and down to increase/ decrease the number and press select when done.

# OAF: Optional and additional features

And these go here.

* Story mode is implemented with increasing N and M and decraesing D and T until the player fails a stage.
* The menu allows the user to select practice mode or story mode.
* A time limit T for inputting the next character, this value can be changed in the menu but is set to 5 seconds
originally.
*T is displayed as a countdown and goes down in steps of 0.1 seconds.
*Sequences of length greater than N=10 occur in stages later than stage 4 in story mode, you can also set N up to N=12
in the menu and so play practice mode with N up to 12.
