# BSc-embedded-systems-coursework
This repository contains my coursework for my Embedded Systems module, completed during my BSc Computer Science Degree. 

This coursework was implemented in an Arduino with a text display, multiple buttons and an RGB light. I programmed the Arduino using the Arduino IDE and wrote a memory game in C++, with progressive levels and adjustable settings. The Arduino would flash a sequence of colours and the user would be required to repeat it using the corresponding buttons, if they got it right, they progressed to the next level, and if not they lost.

This repository includes a report of the project named 'report'. The program is in the 'NiushaS-cw' INO file.
